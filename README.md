If error comes, try npm install serve


# Note
<ul>
  <li>1.>Both the sites are not perfect and have responsiveness problems in the sidebar thing.__</li>
<li>2.> When the client server is running, a blank screen will be noticed. To get the client screen go to localhost:5000/doc/<>
    ,<> -> Doctor's Name</li>
<li>3.> I was not able to add state functionality because of less time as I was busy the first day. __</li>
<li>4.> There is no back button in pre-call check, so you have to go back using browser only</li>
